  caption: "Parabolic approximation to a surface and local eigenframe. The surface\
    \ on the left is a second-\xADorder approximation of a surface at the point where\
    \ the coordinate axes are drawn. The surface has a local normal at that point\
    \ which is related to the cross product of the two tangents of the coordinate\
    \ curves that cross at the that point. The three directions define a coordinate\
    \ system. The coordinate system can be translated so that the origin lies at the\
    \ point where the surface is expanded and rotated so that the normal n coincides\
    \ with the z-axis as in the right hand curve. (Image by Prof. W. Craig Carter.)"
