The class uses examples from the materials science and engineering core courses ([3.012](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-012-fundamentals-of-materials-science-fall-2005/) and [3.014](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-014-materials-laboratory-fall-2006/)) to introduce mathematical concepts and materials-related problem solving skills. Topics include linear algebra and orthonormal basis, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, quadratic forms, tensor operations, symmetry operations, calculus of several variables, introduction to complex analysis, ordinary and partial differential equations, theory of distributions, and fourier analysis.",
